# MandatoryFun

Step 1: Create a new competition with `/new_competition`

- input a competition title
- input a competition description

Step 2: Add teams (channels) to the competition with `/add_channel`

Other commands that I need to make:

- `/delete_competition`
- `/new_challenge`
- `/delete_challenge`
- `/end_competition`
- `/add_team`
  - if team not already in list, then add to list
  - if team in list, send message saying that team is already in the list
- `/team_list`
- `/new_competition`
  - if competition already a name for that user, then don't create
    competition

Problems I eventually need to deal with:

- authentication from different app/users

TODO August 10:

- pass web client from index.js or read about it
- make commands folder
- put interactions not in index.js
- reuse code for adding team or add team
